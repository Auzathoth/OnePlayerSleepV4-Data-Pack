# One Player Sleep Data Pack for Minecraft 1.15 / 1.16 ++

Thank you for choosing my data pack! To better serve the community I've  added some fool-proofing needed for servers with odd settings like having the weather cycle off. Many years of testing in several servers and addressing all the problems has made this a really solid pack.

## Features:
This One Player Sleep Data Pack allows a player to skip the night on a Multiplayer Server.

Some of the features include:
  - Plug and Play. Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder of your world everything will be installed automatically
  - Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
  - Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skiping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.
  - Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
  - Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.
  - Players can stop storms if they go to sleep when is daytime.

## Version 4.0 Changelog:
  - No longer using the /data command or looking for nbt
  - Most checks are now done via predicates improving the data pack performance
  - This version is no longer compatible with older versions of Minecraft
  - No personal player scores are stored anymore
  - No time query is performed anymore, also storing current time in a scoreboard is not needed anymore.
  - Removed references to old data packs and scoreboards
  - Updated meta data for the new data pack browser introduced in Minecraft 1.16 

## Version 4.1 Changelog:
  - Fixed predicate to consider clearing regular rain, it was only clearing storms

## Version 4.1 Changelog:
